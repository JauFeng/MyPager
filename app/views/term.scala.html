                        <p>
                            Telemedicine involves the use of audio, video or other electronic communications to interact with you, consult with your healthcare provider and/or review your medical information for the purpose of diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and/or education. During your telemedicine consultation, details of your medical history and personal health information may be discussed with you or other health professionals through the use of interactive video, audio or other telecommunications technology. Additionally, a physical examination of you may take place, and video, audio, and/or photo recordings may be taken.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information and imaging data, and will include measures to safeguard the data to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.

                        <p>
                            As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                                    In rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information;
                                </p>

                        <h3>What Service does Pager Provide?</h3>
                        <p>Pager is designed to offer information and a means to enable you to obtain telephonic and in-person consultations and treatment for common medical conditions by facilitating the connection between you and nearby health care professionals through the use of the Application. For the avoidance of doubt, the capitalized word “Services” as used in this Agreement refers only to our Application, website and related content and does not refer to the telephonic and in-person consultations and treatment that users receive from health care professionals.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How to Use the Application?</h3>

When signing up, you are obligated to provide us with certain information, such as your name, address, date of birth, credit card information and the name of your primary care provider (if you have one).

Upon successful completion of the sign up process, we will provide you with a personal account, accessible for you with a password of your choice.
                        </p>
                        <p>You have to be 18 years of age or older and reside in a jurisdiction in which we offer the Application to use the Application. If you reside in a jurisdiction that restricts the use of the Application because of age, or restricts the ability to enter into contracts such as this one due to age, you must abide by such age limits and you must not use the Application.

                        <p>
                            The Application is designed to enable you to send a request for non-emergency medical consultation services to a health care professional. The GPS receiver – which should be installed on the mobile device on which you have downloaded the Application – detects your location. The Application identifies to you healthcare professionals who have licensed the Application from us and that have engaged us to perform related services. You will be able to select a health care professional who you wish will perform healthcare services you. After your selection, the Application then sends a message to the professional you selected that asks the professional whether he or she would like to provide you with the requested healthcare services. In the event a health care professional agrees to provide you with healthcare services, the Application schedules those services and bills you on behalf of the healthcare professional. We make no representation or warranty to you any health care professional will be available to perform health care services

You are responsible for the full fee (and for paying the fee in advance) regardless of whether you later are able to receive reimbursement from your health plan for part or all of the cost.

                            This Agreement is personal to you and you may not assign it to anyone. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
